# Cryptocurrencies


##  Overview 
For this project I used data from coincompare to filter data  by traded, mined currencies, and dropping unnecessary columns. After standardizing the data,  I performed standardizetion reduction using PCA to reduce the data set to the most relavent data. A scatter plot for visualization was made. Then, perform k-Means clustering with an elbow plot to identify the optimal number of clusters. Finally, based on the analysis,to make a recommendation on whether the cryptocurrencies can be clustered and into how many clusters. The goal is to reduce the dimensions, cluster the data, and provide insights to clients.
